    "The Ramayana is one of the greatest epics of ancient India, composed by the sage Valmiki. It tells the story of Rama, a virtuous prince, and his journey to uphold dharma (righteousness). Written in Sanskrit, the Ramayana consists of 24,000 verses divided into seven books, known as Kandas. The story has been retold and adapted in many forms across the world and continues to inspire millions of people to this day.",
    
    "Origin of Ramayana\nValmiki, originally a dacoit named Ratnakara, underwent a transformation after a divine encounter that led him to become a sage. He was inspired to compose the Ramayana after witnessing the tragic death of a bird, shot by a hunter. The sorrowful incident moved him deeply, and in his grief, Valmiki uttered a curse that, miraculously, transformed into a poetic verse. This verse, known as the first shloka, marked the beginning of the Ramayana's creation.",
    
    "After this moment, the sage Narada visited Valmiki and narrated the divine story of Lord Rama. He encouraged Valmiki to meditate on Rama’s life, which led to the composition of the epic. Valmiki is said to have received divine insight during his meditations, allowing him to tell the story with immense clarity and depth. The story of Rama, which had been passed down through oral tradition, was now immortalized in Valmiki’s verses.",
    
    "Cultural Significance\nThe Ramayana is not just a tale of heroism but also a profound moral guide. It teaches essential values that have been embedded in Indian culture for centuries. These values include:\n- Obedience to duty, as seen in Rama’s selfless exile to honor his father’s promise.\n- Devotion and loyalty, demonstrated by Sita’s unwavering love for Rama.\n- Friendship and service, embodied by Hanuman’s undying dedication to Rama and his cause.\n",
    
    "The Ramayana has transcended time and geography. Its impact can be seen across India, Southeast Asia, and even parts of the Western world, where its themes of duty, righteousness, and devotion resonate deeply. It is not only a religious text but also a cultural, literary, and philosophical treasure. Throughout the ages, the Ramayana has influenced countless works of art, literature, theater, dance, and music.",
    
    "Structure of the Ramayana\nThe epic is divided into seven parts, each of which tells a distinct part of Rama’s life:\n1. **Balakanda** - Rama’s childhood and early life, his birth, and his marriage to Sita.\n2. **Ayodhyakanda** - Rama’s exile to the forest to honor his father’s promise, and his departure from Ayodhya.\n3. **Aranyakanda** - Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana’s life in the forest, including their encounter with the demoness Surpanakha and Ravana’s plot.\n4. **Kishkindhakanda** - Rama’s alliance with the monkey king Sugriva and the search for Sita, which leads to meeting Hanuman.\n5. **Sundarakanda** - Hanuman’s daring journey to Lanka to search for Sita, marking one of the epic’s most revered chapters.\n6. **Yuddhakanda** - The great war between Rama’s army and Ravana’s forces, culminating in the defeat of Ravana and the rescue of Sita.\n7. **Uttarakanda** - Rama’s return to Ayodhya, his coronation as king, and the events that follow, including his later life and departure from the world.",
