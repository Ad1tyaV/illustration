  "content": [
    "King Dasharatha of Ayodhya, a noble and just ruler of the Ikshvaku dynasty, faced a profound sorrow—despite being married to three queens, Kaushalya, Kaikeyi, and Sumitra, he remained without an heir. Deeply distressed, Dasharatha sought the advice of sages, who recommended performing the Putrakameshti Yagna, a sacred fire ritual designed to invoke the blessings of the gods for progeny. Sage Rishyasringa conducted the ritual, and the gods were pleased.",

    "Lord Vishnu, hearing the prayers, decided to incarnate as Dasharatha's son to rid the world of evil forces, particularly the demon king Ravana. During the yagna, a celestial figure emerged from the flames carrying a golden bowl of nectar, symbolizing divine blessings. Dasharatha distributed the nectar among his queens: Kaushalya consumed the largest portion, Kaikeyi received another, and Sumitra, with great humility, consumed two smaller portions.",

    "In due time, Kaushalya gave birth to Rama, an embodiment of Lord Vishnu, Kaikeyi bore Bharata, and Sumitra had twins, Lakshmana and Shatrughna. Rama’s birth marked the dawn of hope and righteousness. The entire kingdom of Ayodhya erupted in celebrations, with music, dance, and festivities lasting for days. People rejoiced at the divine arrival of the four princes, whose lives would later be intertwined with destiny and dharma."
